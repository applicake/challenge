== Longest Repeated Substring

This week's task is to write a script that finds the longest repeated substring in a given text.

Repeated substrings may not overlap. If more than one substring 
is repeated with the same length, you should print all of them, separated with spaces. 
If there is no repeated substring, the result is an empty string ("").


Make sure your code runs efficiently when passed a large text.

=== The input

The input should be a string (preferably with repeated substring)


=== The output

The output should be the longest repeated substring of a input text


=== Solution format

Let's assume your file is called solutions/mysolution.rb

  class Mysolution
  
    def fetch_substring(text)
      # This method returns a string
    end
    
  end
