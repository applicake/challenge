== Solitaire Cipher

This challenge was taken from the Ruby Quiz:
http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz1.html

"Cryptologist Bruce Schneier designed the hand cipher "Solitaire" for Neal Stephenson's book "Cryptonomicon". Created to be the first truly secure hand cipher, Solitaire requires only a deck of cards for the encryption and decryption of messages.

While it's true that Solitaire is easily completed by hand given ample time, using a computer is much quicker and easier. Because of that, Solitaire conversion routines are available in many languages, though I've not yet run across one in Ruby.

This week's quiz is to write a Ruby script that does the encryption and decryption of messages using the Solitaire cipher."

=== Goal

The goal is to write a script which will decode the following messages:

CLEPK HHNIY CFPWH FDFEH

ABVAW LWZSY OORYK DUPVH

Only solutions with a keystream generator will be taken into account for the benchmark.

=== Solution format

Let's assume your file is called solutions/mysolution.rb

  class Mysolution
  
    def decrypt(message)
      // This method should return the decrypted message
    end
    
  end
